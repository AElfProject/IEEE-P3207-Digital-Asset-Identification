[IEEE-P3207-Standard-for-Blockchain-based-Digital-Asset-Identification](https://github.com/AElfProject/IEEE-P3207-Digital-Asset-Identification)

# Background

The asset identification specification is the key to establishing a digital asset management system, especially when it comes to multi-asset management and cross-chain asset operations. Without a universal digital asset identification specification, asset management based on different protocols will become more and more complicated.

# Scope
* Define the data structure related to digital asset identification;
* Define data format specifications related to digital asset identification;
* Propose asset management operation specifications related to digital asset identification.

# Purpose
This standard defines the data structure related to asset identification to improve the digital asset management efficiency, provide guidance for the design of digital asset management solutions, and provide a reference for building a digital asset service platform.
